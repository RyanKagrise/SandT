# Scuba and Travel Capstone

Scuba and Travel is a full stack application that allows users to post scuba related articles, comment on those articles, and read other's posts! Coming soon will be photos and travel destinations!


## Technologies Used

Scuba and Travel was designed using Flask, SQLAlchemy, Docker, Python, React, Redux, and more! You can sneak a peek at the footer for a comprehensive list!


## Using the Application

In order to utilize the application, start by cloning/downloading the application. Using the .env example provided, generate a local .env file. Upon completion, open a terminal and navigate to the capstone folder. Run the command "pipenv shell" to engage the docker environment. Next run the commands "flask db upgrade", followed by "flask seed all". Once this is complete run the command "flask run". In a seperate terminal, cd into the "react-app" folder. Next run the command "npm start". This should launch a local version of the application!
